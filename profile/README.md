About Valkyrja
------------

Valkyrja is the Old Norse spelling for Valkryrie, a mythical creature that
would guide warriors to Valhallah (the afterlife and a better place) after
death. In a similar sense, the Valkyrja framework guides your application to be
in a better state. Let this fast, light, and robust framework do the heavy
lifting for your app.
